# PostgreSQL Full Text Search Example

A look at using full text searching in PostgreSQL.  Prepared for
[NEWPATH](https://cse.osu.edu/current-students/newpath).

## Getting Setup

You'll need [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed. If you're on a Mac I recommend
installing [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and
[homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask).  Then you can
simply run `brew cask install virtualbox vagrant`  

Then just clone this repo, cd into it and run `vagrant up`.

The first time this runs it will download the base box and run all updates on
it.  This may take a while, try to do it ahead of time if possible.
